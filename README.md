# ðŸŒ† Smart City Lights Management System (SCLMS)

Welcome to **SCLMS**, an IoT-based system designed to manage and monitor city lights based on light intensity. The system uses an **ESP32 WROOM** microcontroller and a **BH1750 light sensor** to detect fluctuations in light intensity, with fluctuations identified by rapid changes in intensity.

---

## Current Features  

- **Lights Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of city lights with intensity fluctuations detected by the sensor.
- **Fluctuation Detection**: Identifies rapid changes in light intensity.
- **Fluctuation Report**: Generates a report of fluctuated lights along with their location.
